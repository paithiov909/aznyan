\usage{
read_still(filename)

write_still(nr, filename = "azny-still.png")

write_animation(
  frames,
  filename = "azny-anime.webp",
  delay = 1/12,

}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{A file name.
For \code{read_still()}, the path to the input image file.
For \code{write_still()} and \code{write_animation()}, the output file name.}

\item{nr}{A \code{nativeRaster} object.}

\item{frames}{A character vector of file names representing animation frames.}

\item{delay}{Frame delay in seconds.
Internally converted to milliseconds, with a minimum of 10ms.}

\item{quality}{Image quality for WebP animation.
For other image formats, this argument is ignored.}

\item{loop_count}{Number of animation loops.
A value of \code{0} means infinite looping.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{read_still()} returns a \code{nativeRaster} object.
\item \code{write_still()} and \code{write_animation()} invisibly returns \code{filename}.
}
}
\description{
These functions provide convenient helpers for reading still images,
writing still images, and creating animated image files.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{read_still()}:
Reads a still image file and converts it into a \code{nativeRaster}.
\item \code{write_still()}:
Writes a still image file from a \code{nativeRaster}.
\item \code{write_animation()}:
Writes an animated image file from a sequence of image files.
}
