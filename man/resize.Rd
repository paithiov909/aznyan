  resize_mode = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0),

\arguments{
\item{nr}{A \code{nativeRaster} object.}

\item{wh}{A numeric vector of length 2.
\itemize{
\item For \code{resize()}: scaling factors when \code{set_size = FALSE}, or target dimensions (\code{width}, \code{height}) when \code{set_size = TRUE}.
\item For \code{resample()}: downsampling factors in each direction.
}}

\item{resize_mode}{An integer scalar selecting the interpolation mode for \code{resize()}.
Must be one of \verb{0–6}, corresponding to OpenCV's interpolation flags.}

\item{set_size}{A logical scalar.
If \code{TRUE}, \code{wh} is interpreted as absolute output dimensions;
if \code{FALSE}, \code{wh} is used as scaling factors.}

\item{resize_mode1}{An integer scalar giving the interpolation mode for the
downsampling step in \code{resample()}. Must be one of \verb{0–6}.}

\item{resize_mode2}{An integer scalar giving the interpolation mode for the
upsampling step in \code{resample()}. Must be one of \verb{0–6}.}
}
\value{
A \code{nativeRaster} object.
}
\description{
These functions provide flexible image scaling based on OpenCV's
\code{resize}, supporting both direct resizing and two-stage
downsample–upsample resampling. The operations apply to all BGRA channels.
}
\details{
\subsection{\code{resize()}}{

Resizes an image either by specifying a scaling factor (\code{wh}) or, when
\code{set_size = TRUE}, by specifying a target width and height directly.
Interpolation is controlled through \code{resize_mode}.
}

\subsection{\code{resample()}}{

Downsamples and then upsamples an image, potentially using different
interpolation modes for reduction and expansion. This can be used to create
stylized pixelation or texture effects, depending on the scaling factors and
interpolation methods.
