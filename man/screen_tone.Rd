\title{Apply a screen-tone texture using a threshold map}
\usage{
screen_tone(nr, pattern, bias = 0L, lift = 60L, cutoff = 8L)
}
\arguments{
\item{nr}{A \code{nativeRaster} object.}

\item{pattern}{A \code{nativeRaster} image used as a threshold map. Typically this
is created by tiling a small matrix (e.g. Bayer matrix) to match \code{nr}.}

\item{bias}{Integer. Value to add to pixels that do \emph{not} pass the threshold.
Larger values brighten the corresponding regions (clamped to \verb{[0, 255]}).}

\item{lift}{Integer. Value to add to pixels that \emph{pass} the threshold.
Larger values brighten the corresponding regions (clamped to \verb{[0, 255]}).}

\item{cutoff}{Integer. Offset added to \code{pattern} before thresholding.
Increase this to make it harder for pixels to pass the threshold.}
}
\value{
A \code{nativeRaster} object.
}
\description{
Applies a tiled tone/texture to an image using a grayscale
threshold map (\code{pattern}). For each pixel, the input intensity is compared
with the corresponding value in \code{pattern} (plus \code{cutoff}), and then either
\code{lift} or \code{bias} is added to the pixel value.

This is useful for creating retro print-like textures, ordered-tone patterns,
or "screen tone" overlays when \code{pattern} is a tiled image.
