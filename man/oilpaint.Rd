\usage{
oilpaint(nr, size = 10, ratio = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{nr}{A \code{nativeRaster} object.}

\item{size}{An integer scalar specifying the radius of the neighborhood
used for computing the oil painting effect. Must be at least \code{2}.}

\item{ratio}{An integer scalar controlling the number of intensity bins
used in the stylization process.
Larger values preserve finer variations in tone.}
}
\value{
A \code{nativeRaster} object.
}
\description{
Applies an oil-paint–style effect to a \code{nativeRaster} image.
This filter produces a painterly appearance
by quantizing and aggregating colors within a local neighborhood.
