aznyan is a collection of image filters for R that wraps [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/),
ported from [5PB-3-4/AviUtl_OpenCV_Scripts](https://github.com/5PB-3-4/AviUtl_OpenCV_Scripts).

Still in development. It will probably work, but the API is likely to change.

## Usage

aznyan provides functions that take a `nativeRaster` of image data as their first argument and return a `nativeRaster` after applying the effect. All these functions return a new `nativeRaster` and do not modify the input object in place.

A `nativeRaster` is a built-in datatype in R that stores image data as an integer matrix.
There are several common ways to obtain a `nativeRaster` object:

* Generate or manipulate a `nativeRaster` using [nara](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/nara)
* Capture the contents of a graphics device with [`ragg::agg_capture()`](https://ragg.r-lib.org/reference/agg_capture.html)
* Read image files using functions such as
  * `jpeg::readJPEG(native = TRUE)`
  * `png::readPNG(native = TRUE)`
  * `fastpng::read_png(type = "nativeraster")`
  * `aznyan::read_still()`

For example, you can read a PNG image as a `nativeRaster` like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork) # for layouting native rasters

png <-
  aznyan::read_still(system.file("images/aznyan-256x256.png", package = "aznyan"))
```

This `png` object corresponds to the following image:

![original image](inst/images/aznyan-256x256.png)

With aznyan, you can easily apply various effects to a `nativeRaster` image.

```{r}
#| label: opencv-filters
#| fig-alt: "Median blur, diffusion filter, and morphological transformation filters applied to a sample image"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 2
blur <-
  wrap_elements(full = aznyan::median_blur(png, ksize = 8)) +
  labs(title = "Median Blur")
diffusion <-
  wrap_elements(full = aznyan::diffusion_filter(png, factor = 8)) +
  labs(title = "Diffusion Filter")
morph <-
  wrap_elements(full = aznyan::morphology(png, ksize = c(4, 4, 4))) +
  labs(title = "Morphological\nTransformation")

(blur | diffusion | morph)
```

In addition to general-purpose image effects, aznyan also provides photo-style color filters ported from [Rustagram](https://github.com/ha-shine/rustagram), such as the following:

```{r}
#| label: color-filters
#| fig-alt: "Other color filters applied to a sample image"
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 16
#| echo: false
all_filters <- c(
  "1977",
  "aden",
  "brannan",
  "brooklyn",
  "clarendon",
  "earlybird",
  "gingham",
  "hudson",
  "inkwell",
  "kelvin",
  "lark",
  "lofi",
  "maven",
  "mayfair",
  "moon",
  "nashville",
  "reyes",
  "rise",
  "slumber",
  "stinson",
  "toaster",
  "valencia",
  "walden"
)

png <- aznyan::read_still(
  system.file("images/city.png", package = "aznyan")
)
images <-
  purrr::map(all_filters, ~ {
    wrap_elements(full = aznyan::color_filter(png, .)) + labs(title = .)
  }) |>
  wrap_plots(ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

print(images)
```

In practice, a convenient way to use aznyan is as a custom filter via
[`ggfx::with_custom()`](https://ggfx.data-imaginist.com/reference/with_custom.html),
which allows you to apply effects to arbitrary ggplot layers.
For example:

```{r}
#| label: ggfx-with-custom
#| fig-alt: "A density plot applied the stylize effect using ggfx."
#| fig-width: 8
#| fit-height: 6
library(ggfx)

my_effect <- \(x, ...) {
  vp <- get_viewport_area(x)
  vp <- aznyan::stylize(vp, ...)
  set_viewport_area(x, vp)
}

ggplot(mpg) +
  with_custom(
    geom_density(aes(cty, fill = drv), alpha = 0.4, adjust = 2),
    filter = my_effect
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma")
```
